### **Software Design:**
Constraints on any process design that you choose is
1. **Social:** We have to build, maintain trust, repair relationship when they've been damage. If I have an API and you're calling the API and I want to change the design of API, then you say The new API sucker because you have to change all your code to call the new API (You're not going to be happy with me). The way to address that is to align ```Authority``` and ```Responsibility```. You have to understand the thinking behind old API and now maybe you have to understand the new API. It's a responsibility of the designer who making design change to make sure that everybody learns what they need to learn in order to adapt to the new design change.
2. **Incentive:** If you're going to design software. You need to reginize that ```everybody's incentives are not the same```. It's okay we don't all have to see things the same way, But we have to agree on next step to take.
3. **Change:** The social structure that you build is going to change over time. Juniors don't stay Juniors forever not if you do it right people, People come, People go, Market change, Technology change.
